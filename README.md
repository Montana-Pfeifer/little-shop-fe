# Little Shop | Group Project | Frontend Starter Repo

This Little Shop FE Group Project is built to consume and display the data from the BE Rails API built in the Mod 2 Group Project.  
 

### Abstract:

As a team, we developed a dynamic front-end web application that addresses the common challenge of efficiently organizing and finding products across multiple merchants. Our solution features an intuitive user interface enhanced with CSS styling for a visually appealing experience.

This application solves the problem of information overload and decision fatigue often experienced by online shoppers. By providing powerful sorting and filtering tools, we've simplified the process of comparing products and merchants.


### Installation Instructions:
1.Fork repo from github url.
2.Clone forked repo and rename it, be careful not to clone into the backend repo.
3.Runnpm install
4.Run npm run dev to start developing.
5.You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"

### Preview of App:
(Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)

### Context:
(Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? What specific work/improvements did you contribute to this FE application?)
We had nine days to write endpoint functionality and testing into the back end API and re-style the front end as well as refactoring multiple methods. This front end was refactored and had multiple pieces of functionality over the course of the project.

### Learning Goals:
For this project, our learning goals included enhancing our technical skills in integrating front-end and back-end programs, with a particular focus on building and connecting APIs. 
We aimed to improve our front-end design abilities and deepen our understanding of fundamental design principles. Additionally, we sought to refine our API testing skills and overall testing practices. 
We planned to enhance our team's scheduling and planning efforts while effectively managing GitHub pull requests. Ultimately, we aimed to synthesize all the knowledge we gained about APIs and testing 
to achieve a holistic understanding of the development process.


### Wins + Challenges:
Some wins for this project included learning of complex css styling processes and creating a complex sorting function to display sorting methods within a drop down menu.
We also all feel our understanding of MVC and
